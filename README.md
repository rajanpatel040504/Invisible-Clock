# 🧙‍♂️ Invisible Cloak using OpenCV

This is a fun Python project that simulates a **Harry Potter-style invisible cloak** using your webcam and the OpenCV library. When you wear a red-colored cloak or hold a red object in front of your webcam, the object will magically disappear — replaced by the background — creating the illusion of invisibility!
